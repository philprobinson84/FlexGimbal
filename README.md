# FlexGimbal
A flexible gimbal class for Arduino and other MCUs. 

Written in C++ and tested with the Arduino IDE v.1.8.2 and Arduino Uno R3 hardware.

## Goal
To provide a lightweight, flexible and feature-rich gimbal class suitable for use with Arduino and other microcontrollers.

## Features
* Stabilisation (Currently limited to two axes, yaw and pitch, using the MPU-6050 6-axis MEMS sensor).
* Servo motor support
* Joystick control
* Brushless DC motor support (* in development)
